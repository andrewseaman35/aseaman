        <p>
            This is a stupid little thing I threw together as a personal introduction to
            image processing with OpenCV in Python. It takes a shape that's drawn (by you)
            on the canvas below, and compares it to a bunch of pictures that I have of my cat.
            It compares the shape to the shape of my cat in each photo and returns
            the photo where Jasper is the  most shaped like the shape you drew. Useless, right?
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, if you're interested about how this works, you can check out my page
            on {{ macros.link_to("jasper/comparing", "comparing my cat to shapes") }}. Otherwise, go ahead and try it out. <strong>Draw a shape below!</strong>
