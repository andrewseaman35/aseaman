                    (8) 8ft 2x4s - I ended up getting 9 since I miscut a piece :)

                    1" nominal thick common board - this was used to match heights of the tops of the drawer and
                    cabinet. The thickness here depends on the specifics of the units.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hardboard sheet - used as a top layer over the plywood sheet. I was originally going to get
                    tempered hardboard for its durability but ended up a standard hardboard sheet since
                    tempered hardboard looks pretty ugly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pegboard (24" x 42")

        </div>
        <p>
            I started by putting together the bases for the drawer and cabinet units. Due to the difference in
            height, the base of the (shorter) drawer used the 2x4s standing up on their side to provide 3.5" of
            height while the (taller) cabinet used the 2x4s laying on their side to provide 1.5" of height.
        </p>
        <div class="multi-image-container-outer">
            <div class="multi-image-container">
                <div class="arrow-icon previous"></div>
                {{ macros.captioned_image("workbench/drawer_base.jpg", "Drawer base", lb_group="base") }}
                {{ macros.captioned_image("workbench/cabinet_base.jpg", "Cabinet Base", lb_group="base") }}
                <div class="arrow-icon next"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            On the underside of the drawers, there are two spines that run down the width of the unit. I had to cut
            slits in the drawer base to fit around these spines.
        </p>
        <div class="multi-image-container-outer">
            <div class="multi-image-container">
                <div class="arrow-icon previous"></div>
                {{ macros.captioned_image("workbench/drawer_underside.jpg", "Spine on underside of drawer", lb_group="spine") }}
                {{ macros.captioned_image("workbench/drawer_base_slit.jpg", "Slit cut on drawer base", lb_group="spine") }}
                <div class="arrow-icon next"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Next, I put together the frames that hold the back support beam in place. These both are set up so they are
            3.5" shorter than the height of the cabinet top. This is to allow space for a horizontally running 2x4. The
            cabinet is also around .375" deeper than the drawers, so the back frame on the drawers actually sits off
            the drawer a little. When we attach the frames to the cabinet/drawers later, I add a shim on the drawer side
            to account for this difference.
        </p>
        {{ macros.captioned_image("workbench/backframes.jpg", "Frames on back for support beam") }}
        <p>
            With the bases and backframes in place, I set the units up to get a feed for how it would look once it's all
            in place. This is how the pieces would sit relative to one another. I also threw in the shop vac that I intended
            to have sit in between the two pieces.
        </p>
        {{ macros.captioned_image("workbench/first_placement.jpg", "Placing the two pieces and shop vac") }}
        <p>
            When completed, the shop vac will actually be set back about 6". This is because the top surface has a 6" overhang
            on the backside which isn't being accounted for at this point.
        </p>
