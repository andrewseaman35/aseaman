        <h1>Workbench</h1>
        <p>
            My garage is pretty small and I use it for a home office, gym, storage, and a workshop.
        </p>

            I wanted a workbench that was both space efficient for storage but also easy to use for
            a variety of types of projects. Most commonly, this space would be for software,
            electronics, and 3d printed projects, but I also wanted the space to accomodate
            woodworking projects, as well as provide a surface for project car work.
        </p>

            I took a stab at designing a workbench that incorporated some Husky tool drawers that I
            had been using as my main tool storage. I planned for a tool cabinet to be used opposite
            this tool drawer to provide additional storage space. I also designed it so my
            shop vac could be stored underneath the bench for easy use when working at the bench as
            well as convenient storage. Finally, I designed a pegboard extension that could be mounted
            to the workbench to provide a structure for a freestanding pegbaord.
