                    <h4>IVAR Lamp Mount</h4>
                    <p>
                        My 3D printer is placed right next to an
                        {{ macros.external_link('https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ivar-shelf-unit-pine-s69251345/', 'IKEA IVAR shelf') }}.
                        I made a mount so I could attach a lamp to the shelf and be able to easily move it around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first iteration consisted of a hook that went over one of the crossbars of the IVAR with
                        a small disk that attached to the lamp. This mount worked decently well -- the attachment point worked as I
                        had planned and the hook worked as a hook normally does. The issue was that the neck of the lamp is bendable,
                        and by using a hook, the lamp could not be bent upwards since it would unhook the hook.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To solve this, I added a second locking piece that hooks under the crossbar and locks over the top of the mount.
                        So far, there have been two iterations of the lock. The first iteration had too much tolerance and had a locking
                        mechanism that was too thin so didn't end up locking well. The v2 iteration reduced the tolerances, made the top
                        lock thicker, and also added a nub to lock the bottom of the mount.

                        to protect an Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 with a small perfboard attached. It has some channels for some LEDs, a
                        port for a micro-USB, some channels for the wires to connect the sensors, and two fins to mount the housing.
