        <h1>
            Remote Chess
        </h1>
        <p>
            When building the online chess game I have {{ macros.link_to('chess/index.html', 'here') }},
            I realized I thought it'd be cool to be able to play physical chess with someone but
            remotely. The goal is to be able to play chess with a remote friend, but on physical
            boards. Moves I make on my board are translated to the other board and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of writing this, I'm still working on my proof of concept. I'm taking advantage of my
            3d printer for XYZ movement (eventually, I'd like to build my own system). I have a
            Raspberry Pi running a local server that controls the printer through OctoPrint as well as
            an Arduino that's controlling a hand that grabs the pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll add some nicer pages here later once I compile all my images and whatnot. For now, you
            can check out the source for what's running the game on this website
            {{ macros.external_link("https://github.com/andrewseaman35/aseaman/tree/master/website/js/src/chess", "here") }}
            or the source for what will run to support this system
            {{ macros.external_link("https://github.com/andrewseaman35/remote_chess", "here") }}.

                    <b>Pick up piece:</b> [done] <br/>
                    • designed a printable grabby hand, all pieces will have bases that work with the
                    grabby hand
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Board:</b> [done(ish)] <br/>
                    • designed pieces and spaces that fit together to ensure expected positioning for grabby hand<br/>
                    • printed minimal set of pieces and spaces for testing
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Grab pieces:</b> [done] <br/>
                    • added z-axis movement and hand close movement to grabby hand controlled via Arduino
                    and stepper motors
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Access spaces:</b> [done] <br/>
                    • using 3D printer with OctoPrint as a crutch (for now), set up a server that
                    translates a space ("A5" or "E1") to an OctoPrint request that moves printhead to
                    corresponding position on print bed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Grab pieces on 3D printer:</b> [done] <br/>
                    • designed a way to mount the grabby hand to the print head of the 3D printer
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Move piece:</b> [in progress] <br/>
                    • given the movement of piece (A1 --> A3), move the print via OctoPrint API and the
                    hand via the Arduino <br/>
                    • buuuut, there's some issue with translation. Moves near A1 (0, 0) work well, but the as I send the head farther along a rank or file, the head falls shorter of the expected
                    position. I'm thinking I can just ignore this for now, since it should be easily
                    resolvable once I have my own X-Y axis system

                    <b>Play online chess with physical output:</b> [in progress] <br/>
