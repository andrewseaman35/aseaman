                This website is an ongoing project on mine that I'm using as a way to mess around and learn new things. It doesn't really
                have any goals except for being a mechanism for me to mess with new technologies, put things that I've done, and (hopefully)
                create useful tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll see how many of those things I get to.
